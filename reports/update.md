## Project Update for David's Tower of Duma

## Team Members

Uma Desai, David Abrahams

## Goal

Our goal for this project is to build a fun, engaging game in C++, using the SFML graphics library.

## Learning Goals

We want to:
Learn C++ and get more comfortable using the language
Learn how to build a cool game in C++/SFML from scratch

## How we got started

We did some housekeeping-related things. We set up linting for our project, and wrote our Makefile. We created a window using SFML that rendered a circle.

## Currently working on

We have been working through [this](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/creating-a-city-building-game-with-sfml/137) tutorial on using SFML, and creating a game engine. We have set up a lot of classes that will help us store the Game (things like a `GameState`, a `TextureManager`, which allows us to display images/sprites to the screen, `Animation`, which allows us to animate sprites by having a sequence of images that rotates through to animate a sprite).

## Next Steps
Customize our GameState to be tower-defense specific
Add sprites for enemies in our tower defense game
Write a class for our first kind of tower
Draw a road for the sprites to travel


### Definition of done

Executable code pushed to github
A tower defense game where the player accumulates currency throughout the game, and can use that currency to purchase towers (which shoot the obstacles)
An understanding of the code implementation
