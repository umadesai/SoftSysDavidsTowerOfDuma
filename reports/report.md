## Goal

Our goal for this project was to build a fun, engaging game in C++, using the SFML graphics library.

## Learning Goals

Coming into this project, we were excited to:
  - Learn C++ and get more comfortable using the language
  - Learn how to build a cool game in C++/SFML from scratch
  - Practice object-oriented design

## Resources

We worked through the first 3 steps of [this](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/creating-a-city-building-game-with-sfml/137) tutorial on using SFML, and creating a game engine. We followed this tutorial to help us set up a lot of classes that helped us store the Game (things like a `GameState`, a `TextureManage`, which allows us to display images/sprites to the screen, `Animation`, which allows us to animate sprites by having a sequence of images that rotates through to animate a sprite). We also frequently referenced StackOverflow and SFML documentation for guidance.

## What We Accomplished

  - We create our own version of tower defense, called Davidâ€™s Tower of dUma. Here are some of its main features:
  - Enemies randomly spawn and move along a path
  - Players can place towers everywhere except the path
  - Towers shoot enemies within range and at a set fire rate
  - An enemy that reaches the end of the path is a life lost
  - Each tower placed costs money

## Reflection

We were able to meet our goal of implementing a fun, engaging game in C++. It was difficult getting the project off the ground, and we spent a lot of time designing our classes and trying to get oriented with the SFML library. Once we became familiar, progress increased rapidly. We both feel comfortable that we could extend the game easily, or even use C++/SFML to write future C++ games, which is pretty cool.
