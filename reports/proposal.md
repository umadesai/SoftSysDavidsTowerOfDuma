## Project Proposal for David's Tower of Duma

## Team Members

Uma Desai, David Abrahams

## Goal

Our goal for this project is to build a fun, engaging game in C++/OpenGL or another graphics library. Currently we are thinking of building a tower defense game.

## Learning Goals

We want to:

- Learn C++ and get more comfortable using the language
- Learn how to build a cool game in C++/OpenGL from scratch

## First Steps

- Find good resources for OpenGL documentation.
- Get familiar with game development in C++.
- Have a blank window and render it on the screen
- Write our Makefile
- Draw something (a circle? An image) on the window

## Definition of done

- Executable code pushed to github
- A tower defense game where the player accumulates currency throughout the game, and can use that currency to purchase towers (which shoot the obstacles)
- An understanding of the code implementation
